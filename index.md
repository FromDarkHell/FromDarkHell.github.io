## About Me

Iâ€™m Joe (Thomas), a freelance software developer specializing in desktop and app development. I work with a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks, with a focus on C#, Python, Java, and C++. Additionally, I have done a lot of work using various other languages like, Flutter/Dart, Javascript, HTML/CSS.

Outside of client work, I spend a lot of time reverse-engineering video games, and building tools, mods, and utilities that enhance gameplay experiences.

## What I Do

### Freelance Development

I offer custom software solutions, scripting, and application development. No matter if you need automation tools, game utilities, desktop apps, or API integrations, I can be the solution!
