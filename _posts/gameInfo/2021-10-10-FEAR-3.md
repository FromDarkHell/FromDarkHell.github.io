# File Format
This game uses the `*.dspack` format which can be extracted using [Game Extractor](http://www.watto.org/game_extractor.html).
The source for extracting/reading is available [here](https://github.com/wattostudios/GameExtractor/blob/master/src/org/watto/ge/plugin/archive/Plugin_DSPACK.java).

Downside though is that Game Extractor, doesn't support *decompressing* the files (only some files in the `*.dspack`s are decompressed by default).

## Compression
It seems to be that the compression algorithm it uses is called `MiniPack` (evident via running `strings` on the binary)
