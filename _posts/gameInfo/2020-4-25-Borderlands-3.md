## Game/Speedrun Tools

* [Speedrun Profile Manager]({{site.url}}/assets/downloads/BL3SpeedrunProfileManager.rar) (You need your speedrun profile.sav named as `profile - SPEEDRUN.sav`)

## Disable Intros
Go to \Borderlands3\OakGame\Content\Movies<br/>
Be aware, the folder is spoiler heavy<br/>
Rename/Delete `2KLOGO`, `AMDLOGO`, `GBXLOGO` and `MARCUS_INTRO`<br/>
This doesnt skip the Vault Hunters intro cinematic.<br/>

## Texture Streaming Edits
If you navigate to, `Documents\My Games\Borderlands 3\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\GameUserSettings.ini`<br/>
You'll see at the end of the file something along the lines of: `TextureStreamingViewBoostScale=0.000000`<br/>
You can edit these ini values  and then set your `GameUserSettings.ini` to read-only. If you want to modify any of the values set their respective `Override` value to `1.000000`. I personally use (in order of appearence w/o the `Override` values): `0.5, 0.5, 160`.<br/>
You can also try setting `bUseDynamicResolution` to `True`.
