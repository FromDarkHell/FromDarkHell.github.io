Unlike the other Bethesda games (so far), this game was build and compiled in Unreal Engine 5 (completely!).
You can use the tool [FModel](https://fmodel.app/) in order to view all of the assets.

In order to get the AES-Encryption key, you can run `AESDumpster` on the main shipping exe.
You can also, just read the key: `0xDFA62F3EE8304BBF7A6E153F2F88203F823C47BF0A690D3D4793FB3EFA624F3F` :)
