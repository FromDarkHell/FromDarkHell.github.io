| Key      | Value          |

Notes:
*  Brother 1, 2, 3 are all interchangable along with the missions that unlock their Underground.
*  During `Laser Breach Device`, the `Find a Laser Device Battery` is unusable until the previous objective is complete
*  The code for `Missing Resistance Fighters` is 1609, very well might be possible to skip the fighters & just go to the door.
*  If you don't complete `Raid - Lab X`, you're unable to complete `Lothar and Juju's Trap`
