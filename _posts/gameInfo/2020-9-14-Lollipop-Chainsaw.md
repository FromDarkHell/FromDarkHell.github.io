Most of this page is just already known info with nothing new but just me wanting to compile random things about this dumb game

All of this data was extracted from the game's disc and then parsed with [specific python scripts](https://gist.github.com/FromDarkHell/38b09cc3b22a577659077f85661c7dce)

## Music Information
Note: I hold no claims of owning these assets, they're posted here purely for historical reference

Note: This table was created based off of a [Tumblr post](https://linktm.tumblr.com/post/29913931959/lollipop-chainsaw-complete-soundtrack-rip/amp)

Note 2: Yeah honestly for some reason the .mp3 extracted names don't actually match with the proper in game song number, it makes no sense but y'know *sure I guess*

### Album Download(s)

I also happened to rip out the raw mp3 files (obviously), using some more [python scripts](https://gist.github.com/FromDarkHell/38b09cc3b22a577659077f85661c7dce#file-lollipopchainsawtableparser-py) to parse these tables (after handwriting them :/)
Here's the [output JSON dictionary](https://gist.github.com/FromDarkHell/f5723a6c7c05be430a9b80b945a4f7a0) if you're too lazy to go through the extra steps
Then I created another [Python script](https://gist.github.com/FromDarkHell/38b09cc3b22a577659077f85661c7dce#file-convertmp3names-py) using [`mp3-tagger`](https://pypi.org/project/mp3-tagger/)


So now the ripped MP3 files are available for download on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sGgF4eT9p5NkwS0BGTW89tClyazUiclT/view?usp=sharing). 
Note: Those files don't contain the licensed music (because don't kill me Warner Bros or whoever I like my living)

## Concept Art

### Concept Art Information
In an extracted disc, all of the concept art is stored in the `UICOLLECTION_ARTS__.xxx`, you'll need to decompress it using the Unreal Decompressor (much like all of the other `.XXX` files), then you'll need to rename the extracted output to have a .upk extension. I used gildor's [UModel](https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel) to be able to view & extract all of the texture outputs. Now you've got a crap ton of folders with all of the .png textures (if you extracted them like that as you should). Then I made (and ran obviously) the `organizeArts.py` available in the [Python Gists](https://gist.github.com/FromDarkHell/38b09cc3b22a577659077f85661c7dce).
Here's the weird part: for some reason all of the images are 1024x1024 resolution *but* the right half of the images are cut off and put in the bottom left even though UE3 supports 1x1 -> 4096x4096 (maybe it's a console thing idk)

Now that you've magically obtained the cut off images, you'd want to run `combineImageHalves.py` (in the same gist), now all of your combined concept art is stored in `./OUTPUT` folder

Just as a note: In this album, Cordelia is spelled as Cordiria (I assume because of Japanese transliteration issues), but I'm just keeping it like that here for record's sake.
