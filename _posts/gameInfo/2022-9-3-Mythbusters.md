As the game announces to you when you boot it up, it's made with Unity.
Unity (especially without IL2CPP) is *stupidly* easy to reverse engineer.
For example, I've reversed: 
- [Office Race](/Office-Race)
- [Zoombinis](/Zoombinis)
- [The Spy Who Shrunk Me](Spy-Who-Shrunk-Me)

which are all using Unity so if you've seen those, you've probably seen half the things I'm going to do...

Like any mono Unity game, you can easily load up [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) (a C# / Unity debugger) in order to decompile the main game binary (`Assembly-CSharp.dll`).

## Blueprint Minigames

First I'm gonna just gonna name-drop all of the various blueprint ""puzzles"" (and their solutions where possible just because).

### Quizzes

This puzzle is the most barebones blueprint puzzle. The game doesn't even randomize the question order, so the first question in this table should just always be the first question you get on the quiz blueprint puzzles. I've got basically nothing else to say about this one just becasue its so simple, enjoy your quiz answers ~~you cheater~~.

### Rolling Ball Game

Here's a list of all of the possible solutions and puzzles for the rolling ball blueprint minigame.
This also includes their internal IDs (because why not) as well as their width/height, maximum move count, and difficulty (`s` for small, `m` for medium, `l` for large). This also includes the hints directly ripped from the game itself.

## Myth Mechanics

### Balloon Lift-Off
For this myth, you can choose to place ballasts on either the left or right side of a chair. In addition to placing balloons on the top in order to gain lift.
Most of the classes for this are just named `Balloon[___]`. One of the main classes is the `BalloonExperimentService`. 
This `BalloonExperimentService` class has a `ChangeBalloonState` which will adjust whether or not the balloon-ified chair goes up/down.
```csharp
	/* 
		Function: BalloonExperimentService.ChangeBalloonState 
		Comments added by me <3
	*/
	private static void ChangeBalloonState(GameEntity mainBalloonExperiment, Rigidbody chairHookRigidbody)
	{
		// The `massCanLift.Mass` is equal to (balloon_count * 20)
		int mass = mainBalloonExperiment.massCanLift.Mass;

		// If the balloon lift mass is within 5kg and the ballast mass (`chairHookRigidbody.mass`), start hovering instead.
		if (Math.Abs((float)mass - chairHookRigidbody.mass) <= 5f)
		{
			if (mainBalloonExperiment.hasBalloonChangeHeight)
			{
				mainBalloonExperiment.RemoveBalloonChangeHeight();
				return;
			}
		}
		else
		{
			// This will set whether or not we're rising based on the mass difference.
			// If `balloon lift mass` > `ballast mass`, start rising; otherwise start falling
			mainBalloonExperiment.ReplaceBalloonChangeHeight((float)mass - chairHookRigidbody.mass > 0f);
		}
	}
```
Each balloon can support up to 20 mass units (kilograms by default) while each ballast weighs 20 mass units. The chair has a default mass of 100 mass units (kg). 
If you can do basic algebra, you'll realize that you'll need at minimum 5 balloons to hover (and 6 balloons to gain height obviously)
If you can't do basic algebra, read the following: in order to gain height, the total count of balloons needs to be `(5 + ballast_count + 1)`. In order to lose height, you need to be anything below that value.


## Random Data

### Item Data

By adding code to the `ItemDataInitSystem.Initialize`, you can easily print out a list of all of the items in the game.
This class loads all of it's data from an embedded resource in the Unity bundles. Then it loads the Items into a dictionary structured like `ID: {Item Object}`. 
So I decided to dump out all of the objects and then put it into a [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/176dZpKcdYnKzUM06bA_Uw0vdmiL38lUSQUSKL47HugA/edit?usp=sharing).

### Rocket Data

For the purposes of the rocket myths, there's only 4 types of rocket profiles.
1. Simple
2. Donut (Donut and Star)
3. Cross (Cross / Double C)
4. Octopus
Each of these adjusts how much fuel is used per each frame tick and thus a faster rocket.
The same thing applies for the fuel types (in order of increasing speed).
1. Poo (4)
2. Salami (20)
3. Sugar (28)
4. Black power (40)
5. Aluminium (50)

### Popularity Bonuses
Whenever you reach a certain amount of popularity, you gain an extra bonus from ye old company overlords.

| Popularity Threshold | Bonus Amount |
|:--------------------:|:------------:|
|         1000         |     500      |
|         2000         |     1000     |
|         3000         |     1500     |
|         5000         |     2500     |
|        10000         |     4000     |
|        30000         |     6000     |
|        50000         |     8000     |
|        100000        |    12000     |
|        200000        |    16000     |
|        500000        |    20000     |
|       1000000        |    24000     |

### Debug Tools

This games uses [SRDebugger](https://www.stompyrobot.uk/tools/srdebugger/) in order to implement it's debug utils. It exposes all sorts of tools via the `SROptions` class.
You can also basically make `SRDebugger.Settings.IsEnabled` always return true in order to enable debug mode.
According to the docs, you open the debug menu with `Ctrl-Shift-F1`.

There's a cheat which allows you to spawn **infinite** busters:

### Myths / Blueprints Data

For reference, `The First Experiment` version of this game contains all of the myths in this table, but it blocks out everything aside from `Hero's Gambit` and `Balloon Chair` by just setting the minimum blueprints to `999`

Here's a list of all of the blueprint IDs as well (as of the initial release of the game). You'll notice that there's a few cut blueprints (namely 4003, and 4009) which are for the [reverse drive myth](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1766851/).

#### Demo Missions

In order to load one of the extra missions that's loaded from the MythBoard, you'll need to edit some of the code to set the myth ID of the myth you're loading.
You'll edit: `GameEntity.ReplaceMythSelected` and `GameEntity.AddMythSelected` to set `newMythId` to whatever myth ID you choose, up above is a list of all of the possible myth ID values.

## Speedrun Notes

There's a few extra bits of speed tech that apply for all of the speedrun categories so I'm just going to mention them here.
If you need to fast-travel/teleport, you can just save* quit and you'll instantly get warped back to where you loaded the map in from.
The assistant is absolutely *cracked* and so, just always spec for it first.

### Core Myths
This category just involves doing the main 4 myths/blueprints (Hero's Gambit, Balloon Chair, Curving The Bullet, Salami Rocket)
