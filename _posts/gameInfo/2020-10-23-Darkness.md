## Darkness 1

Darkness 1 is PS3/X360 exclusive so I don't have much to spew out my mouth about
But considering (unlike Darkness 2) it was developed by Starbreeze Studio, I'd bet its a proprietary engine or Unreal Engine 2 or 3.

## Darkness 2
Unlike Darkness 1, this game actually came out on PC (and I got it for free from some sale as far as I remember)
This game uses [Digital Extremes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Extremes)'s proprietary [Evolution engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Extremes#Technology) (in fact its the second game to use it)
The game's files are combinations of `.toc` (Table of Contents) and `.cache` (*Cache*)
Side fact: The game's PDB was stored at `c:\Darkness2PC\Code\EE.SteamCEG.pdb` in development :)

### Avoiding Ear Painâ„¢
The game launches with an impressively loud 2K intro movie, in order to avoid having your ears bleed:
1. Navigate to your game folder
2. Go to `[GAME FOLDER]/Cache.Windows`
3. Delete/Rename `F.VideoTextureSlow.toc`
	* Since the `F.VideoTextureSlow.toc` contains other non-intro movie files, you can [download]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/downloads/darkness/F.VideoTextureSlow.toc) a hex-edited version to remove the intro movie itself 

### Table of Contents Format
According to some `XeNTaX` [forum](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=10782#p88313) posts about Warframe (another Evolution engine game) (probably not the most trustworthy site btw):
* 'H' caches contain file headers
* 'B' caches contain the corresponding binary files (except for sounds, and maybe textures)
* 'F' caches contain full sound files and textures

That forum post also contains a link to a [QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) Script [(Download)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/downloads/darkness/darkness2.bms)

If you wanna make your own implementation (like I tried):
```
Out of File: 
	- Content Amount: ( (Size of TOC) - 8 ) / 0x60

Magic: 0x4E, 0xC6, 0x67, 0x18
Version: int32
TOC File / Category Format (Loop over Content Amount):
	- offset: long
	- timestamp: long
	- zSize: int32
	- size: int
	- paddedBytes: int
	- ID: int
	- Name: 0x40 long ASCII string (remove non-ASCII chars)
```

The only caveat to this file format being that the .cache files contain `oodle` and `lzf` compressed files
In reality I wouldn't advise making your own implementation of the QuickBMS just because the [oodle](http://www.radgametools.com/oodlecompressors.htm) compression scheme is proprietary and it'll be annoying to actually implement it in in whatever your language of choice is.

There's some somewhat interesting info you can glean from (somewhat poorly) extracting the contents of the caches
The UI (as from `B.AnimRetarget`) uses Uncompressed Shockwave Flash 6 
For more interesting code-bits, I ended up figuring out how to decompile the lua source code (The extension *should* probably be `.luac` on the files but y'know :/)
A github repo of the decompiled code is here: [https://github.com/FromDarkHell/TheDarknessIIDecompiled](https://github.com/FromDarkHell/TheDarknessIIDecompiled)

### Config Files
All of these go in `%appdata%/DarknessII`, I'm yet to figure out their format but, could potentially be something?
1. `Editor.cfg` - There's a lot of references to the game's editor, yet it lacks anyway to access it in game afaik
2. `EE.cfg` - `EE` is probably short for `Evolution Engine`
3. `[STEAM ID]/settings`: Config file matched up with your steam ID

### Images
These are all just random promo images from the 2K site, best enough to keep them ripped from there.
